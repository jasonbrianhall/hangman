```

### MS-DOS Version
```bash
# Navigate to the c directory
cd hangman/c

# Build using DJGPP (via Docker)
make msdos

# Run in DOSBox
make run

# Or run directly in DOS
hangman.exe (requires cwsdpmi.exe which is downloaded during the build)
```

### UNIX Version
```bash
# Navigate to the c directory
cd hangman/c

# Build using gcc
make unix

# Run in the CLI
./hangman
```

### UNIX Version
```bash
# Navigate to the c directory
cd hangman/c

# Build using gcc
make windows

# Run in the CLI
hangman_windows.exe or wine hangman_windows.exe if on Linux
```

## üéØ Gameplay

1. A random word is selected from the dictionary
2. Guess letters one at a time
3. Watch the hangman develop with each incorrect guess
4. Track your available letters and progress
5. Win by completing the word or lose when the hangman is complete
